# Part 1

We will be building a simple Hello World website!

## Steps
1. Create the file `app.py`
1. In `app.py`:
    * Import `Flask` from `flask`
    * Create a `Flask` object called `app`
    * Add a route to `app` to handle `GET` requests to the root path `/`
    * In the request handler, return "Hello World!" (or your favorite string)
    * Run the app
1. To start the server, run `python3 app.py`
